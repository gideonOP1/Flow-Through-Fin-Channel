# Flow-Trhough-A-Fin-Channel
## A Numerical Solution to a problem of flow entering an enclosed chamber implemented in pyhton3 with numpy and matplotlib.
Numerical solution of Navier Stokes equation in 2D is used to solve the problem. A projection method which decouples the pressure and advection terms is implemented using FTCS (Forward in Time , Central in Space) scheme.
