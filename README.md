# Flow-into-enclosed-chamber
## This is a Numerical Solution to a problem of flow entering an enclosed chmaber solved using the 2D Navier stokes equation which isimplemented in pyhton3 with numpy and matplotlib.
A projection method which decouples the pressure and advection terms is implemented using FTCS (Forward in Time , Central in Space) scheme. This FTCS Scheme is used to solve the partial differential equations.  ##
